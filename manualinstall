    to install pip on the system.

     % cd /tmp
     % wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
     %  python get-pip.py

3. Verify that the required python packages are installed. The follwoing pip 
   command will install any of the packages that are missing.

   % pip install daemonize flask flask_sqlalchemy sqlalchemy flask_marshmallow marshmallow-sqlalchemy

4. Create the application run area as root
    % mkdir /opt/blogsapi

    Note: If you install this somehere other than /opt/blogsapi you will need to
          up the configuration file configfile to reflect these changes.

5. Create a user to run the blog server using what ever process you use to 
   create new user account. For this document we use bloguser
5. Change ownership and permissions of this new area (/opt/blogapi)
    % chown bloguser /opt/blogapi
    % chmod 750 /opt/blogapi

6. As the user bloguser pull the application into a temporary area.  
   % git clone <PATH> /tmp/blogapi

7. As the <blogsuer> account copy required filesa. The follwoing command assumes   you cloned into /tmp/blogapi and the run area is /opt/blogapi

   % cp /tmp/blogapi/files/blogapi.py /opt/blogapi
   % cp /tmp/blogapi/files/blog.db.master /opt/blogapi/blog.db
   % cp /tmp/blogapi/files/testbasicapi /opt/blogapi
   % cp /tmp/blogapi/configfile.manualinstall /opt/blogapi/configfile

8. The configuration file in a json file. The things that are supported are
    install_path :: This is the application path (/opt/blogapi)
    pidfile_path :: This is the path used for the pidfile. This is used to as
                    locking and the kill operation requires this file.
    database_file:: This is the name of the database file (blog.db). If you 
                    change this then you need to create the database file.
    logfile_path :: This defines the path to create the application logfile. 
  
7. The application is now ready to use. To start the application server type
   % /opt/blogapi/blogapi.py start

9. The script testbasicapi provides tests that will run a GET to pull all blog entries and then run 2 PUT's to added blogs. This uses simple curl commands to run the tests. You can either just run it or run the curl commands to verify that everything is working.
